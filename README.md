Have you ever played hangman? It's a children's game, normally played by kids when they're supposed to be doing homework instead. If you've never played here are the rules:
    This game should give the number of characters in the word.

    The "gallows" and the empty letter spaces should be drawn, and player 2 should be allowed to guess letters until they either win, or lose.

    As they choose correct letters, the letters should appear on the screen in place of the dashes (clear and redraw the whole screen). As they choose wrong letters, the "man" himself should come end up being drawn, piece by piece. How many guesses they get before losing is up to you (depending on how complicated of a man you want to draw).
